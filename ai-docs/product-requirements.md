# Agentic Arena - Product Requirements Document

## Product Vision
Create a comprehensive evaluation platform for agentic coding workflows - a "Kaggle meets Leaderboard" for AI-assisted development tools that promotes transparency, benchmarking, and community-driven optimization of AI coding practices.

## Problem Statement
- No standardized evaluation framework exists for agentic coding tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Bolt44, Lovable, etc.)
- Developers gatekeep their optimal workflows due to competitive advantage
- Lack of objective metrics to compare different AI coding approaches
- No community-driven platform to share and improve AI-assisted development practices

## Target Market
- **Primary**: AI-powered development tool users (developers, researchers, AI enthusiasts)
- **Secondary**: AI tool vendors seeking benchmarking and validation
- **Tertiary**: Enterprise teams evaluating AI coding tools for adoption

## Core Value Propositions

### 1. Standardized Benchmarking
- Consistent evaluation criteria across different agentic systems
- Objective metrics for workflow comparison
- Reproducible evaluation environment

### 2. Transparency & Knowledge Sharing
- Open workflow sharing with detailed execution logs
- Token usage, tool call, and performance analytics
- Best practice identification and dissemination

### 3. Community-Driven Optimization
- Competitive leaderboards driving innovation
- Collaborative improvement of prompting strategies
- Attribution-based workflow sharing

### 4. Research & Development Insights
- Public dataset of agentic coding patterns
- Performance analytics across different tools and models
- Evidence-based optimization recommendations

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement

- Benchmark task completion rates
- User trust scores and verification rates

### Business Impact
- Tool vendor partnerships and integrations
- Enterprise evaluation tool adoption
- Research paper citations and academic recognition

## User Stories

### As a Developer
- I want to submit my AI coding workflows to see how they rank against others
- I want to discover optimal prompting strategies for specific coding tasks
- I want to compare different AI tools objectively on identical tasks

### As a Researcher
- I want to access aggregated data on agentic coding performance patterns
- I want to contribute benchmark tasks that advance the field
- I want to validate my workflow optimization hypotheses

### As an AI Tool Vendor
- I want to demonstrate my tool's performance against competitors
- I want to understand usage patterns and optimization opportunities
- I want to engage with the community using my platform

## Key Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Workflow Submission System**
   - Support multiple agent export formats (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)
   - Metadata validation and parsing
   - File upload and storage management

2. **Evaluation Framework**
   - Standardized benchmark task definitions
   - Automated scoring algorithms
   - Manual review and validation capabilities

3. **Leaderboard System**
   - Multiple ranking criteria (tokens, speed, cost, correctness)
   - Filtering by tool, model, task category
   - Time-based and all-time rankings

4. **Workflow Visualization**
   - Execution graph rendering
   - Step-by-step breakdown with metrics
   - Comparison view between different approaches

5. **User Management**
   - Profile creation and authentication
   - Submission history and statistics
   - Social features (following, favoriting)

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Security**
   - Submission authenticity verification
   - Protection against gaming and manipulation
   - Secure handling of user data and code

2. **Performance**
   - Fast workflow parsing and analysis
   - Responsive leaderboard updates
   - Efficient large file handling

3. **Scalability**
   - Support thousands of concurrent users
   - Handle large workflow submissions
   - Accommodate growing benchmark task library

4. **Reliability**
   - 99.9% uptime for core functionality
   - Data integrity and backup systems
   - Error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Out of Scope for MVP
- Real-time workflow execution/replay
- Advanced AI-powered workflow optimization
- Enterprise SSO and advanced permissioning
- Mobile application development
- Integration with version control systems

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Agent Format Fragmentation**: Different tools may change export formats
- **Validation Complexity**: Ensuring submission authenticity without hindering adoption
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Large workflow file processing and analysis

### Business Risks
- **Community Adoption**: Building critical mass of active contributors
- **Tool Vendor Cooperation**: Securing partnerships for official integrations
- **Gaming/Manipulation**: Preventing artificial leaderboard inflation

### Mitigation Strategies
- Modular parsing system for easy format adaptation
- Multi-layered validation with community reporting
- Progressive trust scoring system
- Strong community guidelines and moderation
- Official partnerships with leading AI tool providers

## Dependencies
- AI tool vendors for export format specifications
- Community for benchmark task definition and validation
- Cloud infrastructure providers for scalable hosting
- Open source ecosystem for visualization and parsing libraries

## Timeline Constraints
- MVP launch target: 3-4 months from development start
- Beta testing phase: 4-6 weeks before public launch
- Full feature set delivery: 6-8 months post-MVP
