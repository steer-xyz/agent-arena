<prompt 1>
I want to create a web app for a fun personal project that's something along the lines of a leaderboard, or a speedrun leaderboard, or arena for vibe coding apps, or more generally just some sort of evaluation tool for agentic coding. So here's my example. There's a lot of agentic coding tools now like Claude Code, Cursor, Bolt44, Lovable, all these agents. And there isn't really a good way to evaluate the workflow or the prompts used. Like there's evals for reinforcement learning, for example, but there aren't really agreed upon evals for agentic coding. So I want to make some sort of site where you can basically like share your workflow and then the final product. Or maybe there's like a set eval that's like, you know, minimum amount of subtasks, minimum amount of model inference calls, or like minimal amount of tokens consumed to achieve a benchmark. So maybe it's like a B2B SaaS app or blah, blah, blah. And each app has like specific evals that it must pass to get full credit. And I think this would be good as it like builds community. And it also kind of forces people to compete. And by doing that, we will kind of, you know, get closer to a better system to improve our prompting and understand these agentic workflows better. And, you know, people kind of gatekeep their workflows right now, because there's so much value and you can get so much out of it. But maybe this will be a way to kind of promote people sharing like best practices and the optimal way to do these, you know, AI-assisted development workflows. Like something I was thinking of is I know Cloud Code has like an extension or something like that, where you can kind of export the chat and it gives all the details of each prompt, how many tokens are in each prompt, each sub tool that was called by the agent and what was input and what was the output of the tool calls and everything. So my idea is maybe there's certain evals for different systems like Cloud Code might have its own eval, or maybe it's actually better to compare different systems by like the total number of tool calls, the latency of each tool call, how many tokens were consumed in each tool call, maybe like the model cost for that provider. So these are kind of the initial ideas I had, and I want you to basically take my ideas and think really hard and help me kind of draft some sort of work plan or product that I can basically base off of and start building.

This is a fantastic concept — it's like a Kaggle-meets-Leaderboard for agentic coding workflows, with a competitive + collaborative spirit that encourages transparency, benchmarking, and innovation. Here's a structured game plan to help you turn this into a buildable product:

🔧 Product Concept: Agentic Arena (working title)
A platform to evaluate, compare, and share agentic coding workflows (e.g. Claude Code, Cursor, Bolt44, etc.) based on performance metrics like token efficiency, tool call latency, and workflow quality.

🧠 Core Value Propositions
Benchmarking: Standardized evals per task across different agentic systems.

Transparency: Exported execution graphs + token/tool call logs.

Community: Sharing optimal workflows with attribution (think "leaderboard of prompt chains").

Research: Provides public data on tool efficiency and model usage patterns.

🛠️ Core Features
1. Submission + Metadata Upload
Upload workflows (chat logs, tool calls, timestamps, token usage, etc.)

Import/export formats (e.g. Claude Code .json, Cursor history logs)

Optional final output file (code, notebook, text result)

2. Eval Framework
Per task eval templates: e.g.

“Build a Python CLI that fetches Hacker News”

“Refactor legacy code into OOP design”

Metrics captured:

🧠 Model calls count

🧾 Token usage (input/output)

🛠️ Tool invocations (frequency + duration)

⏱️ Latency per step

💰 Cost (in $ if available from provider)

✅ Functional correctness (manual or auto test suite)

3. Leaderboards
Per task, per tool, per model

Sort by:

Least token usage

Fastest completion time

Fewest tool calls

Best final output (upvotes or auto eval)

4. Workflow Viewer
Visualize execution graph of agent steps

See token + tool usage breakdown per node

Comparison view (e.g. Claude vs. Cursor vs. Bolt44 on the same task)

5. Profile Pages
Users can:

Submit workflows

Follow others

Star/save interesting evals

Link to GitHub or share evals externally

🧪 MVP Scope

How will i be able to verify the validity of user submissions

<llm answer 2>
Great question — submission validity is crucial to ensure the leaderboards are fair, the data is trustworthy, and the community actually benefits from the shared workflows. Here’s a breakdown of how you can design a submission validation pipeline, combining technical constraints, trust signals, and optionally community moderation:

✅ Submission Validity: Layers of Defense
🧾 1. Structured Format with Cryptographic Metadata (where possible)
Require users to upload raw logs or structured exports:

For Claude Code: .json exports with token/tool call metadata

For Cursor: agent session logs

Validate:

Timestamp consistency

Tool call inputs/outputs

Total tokens = sum of step-wise tokens

Optionally use:

Hashing: Uploads can include cryptographic hash of the raw session to confirm integrity

Signatures: In the future, agent vendors could sign their outputs

🔒 2. Agent-Specific Submission Parsers
Build agent-specific validators:

Claude Code → Parse .json, validate token counts, function call graph

Cursor → Replayable transcript or compressed diff history

Lovable / Bolt44 → Require standard JSON structure with fields:

tool_calls, token_counts, steps, final_output

You can flag submissions that:

Don’t match expected schema

Have impossible timestamps (e.g. tool call before prompt)

Lack key metadata fields (e.g. token usage or response time)

🧑‍💻 3. Reproducibility / Replay Hooks
Let users optionally:

Upload input task prompt + workflow log

Submit final output file

Enable a “replay agent” button: run same task via API and compare

While you can’t always replay due to stochasticity in LLMs, you can:

Compare total steps and structure

Flag outputs that deviate significantly

🏷️ 4. Submission Attribution + Source Trust Score
Assign a trust score or badge:

“Verified Export” (raw Claude/Cursor file)

“Third-Party Log” (manual JSON)

“Replayable Run” (if task was re-evaluated by server)

Allow filtering leaderboards by:

Trusted logs only

Verified by agent

Reproducible

👥 5. Community Validation (Optional but Powerful)
Like Stack Overflow or Kaggle:

Allow users to upvote good workflows

Flag suspicious / gamed submissions

Comment / ask questions on workflows

This can be moderated lightly, especially for high-profile leaderboard entries.

🧪 6. Automated Sanity Checks
Before scoring a submission:

Check that:

Final output ≠ empty string

Total cost makes sense (e.g. token count * provider pricing)

All tool calls include both input and output

No repeated identical prompts (token inflation trick)
